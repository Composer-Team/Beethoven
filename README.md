# Composer

# Prerequisites 

To compile Chisel programs, the only necessary installations are [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) 
and [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git). Install yaml-cpp so that CMake can find
its installation.


### Verilator

We currently use a Verilator backend for simulation. We may add additional simulation backends in the future.
