# Beethoven

Beethoven is a flexible framework for designing and deploying heterogeneous multi-core hardware accelerators. It simplifies the development process by providing high-level abstractions for communication and platform integration while maintaining performance comparable to hand-written RTL.

We're happy to announce that we'll be presenting a tutorial for Beethoven at [ISCA 2025](https://iscaconf.org/isca2025/) in Tokyo!
If you have the opportunity, we'd love to see you there in person. 

We host the documentation for Beethoven [here](https://composer-team.github.io/Beethoven-Docs/Beethoven/).
